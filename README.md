**Importing Required Modules:**

1.The first line imports all the classes and functions from the tkinter module, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

2.The string module provides various constants containing ASCII characters, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation.

3.The random module is used to generate random passwords.

4.The pyperclip module allows copying text to the clipboard.

**Define the generator() Function:**

* The generator() function generates a password based on the user's choice of password strength and length.
It first creates variables containing different character sets (small alphabets, capital alphabets, numbers, and special characters).
It concatenates all the character sets into the all variable to represent all possible characters.
The function gets the password length from the length_box Spinbox widget.
Depending on the user's choice (retrieved from the choice IntVar), it generates a password using random.sample().
The generated password is then inserted into the passwordField Entry widget.

**Define copy(), delete(), and Other Functions:**

* The 'copy()' function retrieves the generated password from the passwordField Entry widget and copies it to the clipboard using pyperclip.copy().

* The 'delete()' function clears the contents of the passwordField Entry widget.

**Create the Tkinter Main Window and Configure It:**

* This section creates the main window of the application using Tk() and stores it in the variable root.

* It sets the background color of the window to green (bg="green").

* It creates an IntVar named choice to store the user's choice of password strength.

* The window's size is set to 450x500 pixels using geometry('450x500').
* The Font variable is created to store the font settings for various widgets.

**Create GUI Widgets:**

The code creates various widgets using the Label, Radiobutton, Spinbox, Button, and Entry classes to create the user interface for the password generator.

**Link Functions to Buttons:**

The "Generate", "Copy", and "Delete" buttons are linked to their respective functions (generator(), copy(), and delete()) using the command parameter.

**Start the Tkinter Main Event Loop:**

This line starts the main event loop of the Tkinter application, which listens for user interactions and updates the GUI accordingly.

Overall, this code creates a simple password generator application with a GUI using Tkinter. Users can select the password strength, enter the desired password length, and generate, copy, or delete passwords based on their preferences.
